	 * Three pieces of furniture for a long settings tab: the quick-links
	 * anchor nav, a floating Save control and a back-to-top button. Written
	 * to be copied verbatim into the other plugins, so everything below is
	 * self-contained and the only plugin-specific values are the two
	 * constants in CHROME.
	 *
	 * THE HOUSE RULE THIS IMPLEMENTS (resources/hivepress-settings.md, "The
	 * settings anchor nav: one shared marker class", 2026-08-30). Several of
	 * these plugins can decorate one settings screen, so each piece carries
	 * TWO classes: a shared marker that is never styled and exists only so
	 * siblings can find it (`hp-settings-nav`, `hp-settings-save`,
	 * `hp-settings-top`), plus the plugin's own prefixed class carrying all
	 * the CSS. Before rendering a piece, test for its marker with an EXACT
	 * class selector and stand down if a sibling got there first, so the
	 * owner sees one of each however many extensions are active.
	 *
	 * The exact test is the point. The old convention was the substring
	 * `nav[class*="settings-nav"]`, which was blind to three of the plugins
	 * it was meant to see - Account Menu Enhancer's own nav was called
	 * `amehp-section-nav` - and it failed silently.
